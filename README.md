made this to make recording guitar on my phone easier <br>
instead of having to slide the song timestamp back to the same thing everytime just set a timestamp and click a button to go back(wow!)<br>
and when songs start suddenly (tightrope by stevie ray vaughan, thank you for the venom by mcr) you can count in (3 seconds) so you have time to get ready (mega wow!)
